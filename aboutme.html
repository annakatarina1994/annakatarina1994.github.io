    <h1 class="aboutMeTitle">About Me</h1>
    <p class="aboutMeStatement">Throughout my life, I’ve found myself taking an interest in a wide variety of subjects.
      I’ve always been a fan of discovering new things, whether it’s a new trail to hike on, a new medium to create with
      or a new language to learn. I’m an artist, avid learner and developer all snugly wrapped into
      one.<br><br>
      Currently, I'm involved in a software development apprenticeship learning new skills on the daily.
      My interest lies primarily in creating applications and websites with exemplary user interfaces.
      Down the line, I'd ideally like to get more involved in the user experience portion of software, allowing me to
      unite my creativity with my knowledge of software and my Psychology background.<br><br>
      When I'm not coding or learning a new framework, I like to spend my time painting/drawing, playing with my dogs or
      camping and hiking around in the great outdoors.
