<h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="aboutme">
        <p>
            I took time off of school to work and reflect. I learned a lot about myself
            and I decided I wanted to go into a technical field as I did not really feel
            fulfilled in the financial sector, but also did not feel that Social Work was
            the right fit for me. I began a second Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical
            Engineering. There I joined the Supremileage club at the Center for
            Automotive Research, where my
            love for cars was quickly reignited and I wound up being voted in as President.<br /><br />

            However, I found myself more interested in artificial intelligence and
            programming in cars. This led me to the We Can Code IT coding bootcamp.
            I wanted to get a foundation on coding and start my path towards learning
            about AI. Eventually,
            I’d like to have a hand in the AI involved with autonomous vehicles.<br /><br />
