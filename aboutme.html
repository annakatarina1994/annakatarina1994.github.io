<h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="aboutme">
        <p>
            Throughout my life, I’ve found myself taking an interest in a multitude of subjects.
            I’ve always been a fanatic of discovering new things, whether it’s a new trail to hike
             on, a new medium to create with or a new language to learn.  I’m a gear head, artist,
              avid learner and developer all snugly wrapped into one.<br><br>
            At times, I struggled with this. I didn’t have the benefit of knowing where my place 
            was in this world early on. It felt like the world had too much to offer and I didn’t 
            have enough time to try it all. I’m at a point now, however, where I feel like I’ve 
            finally found a place for myself and it’s in the software development world. <br><br>
            I’m particularly interested in creating applications and websites with exemplary user 
            interfaces , drawing a lot of my design choices from my background in behavioral psychology. 
            Later down the line in my career, I’d also like to explore AI and how it can be used for 
            autonomous vehicles.
