        <h2>About Me</h2><br/><br/>
        <p>I was born in the Bronx, New York to immigrant parents that did not speak
            a lick of English. I grew up around Washington D.C. throughout most of
            grade school. I had a difficult upbringing due to my family’s circumstances
            that inspired me to study Psychology and eventually help other kids in similar
            situations. After graduating, I made it into the graduate school for Social Work at Ohio State,
            but was also offered a job with Nationwide in the retirement sector.<br /><br />

            I took time off of school to work and reflect. I learned a lot about myself
            and I decided I wanted to go into a technical field as I did not really feel
            fulfilled in the financial sector, but also did not feel that Social Work was
            the right fit for me. I began a second Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical
            Engineering. There I joined the Supremileage club at the Center for
            Automotive Research, where my
            love for cars was quickly reignited and I wound up being voted in as President.<br /><br />

            However, I found myself more interested in artificial intelligence and
            programming in cars. This led me to the We Can Code IT coding bootcamp.
            I wanted to get a foundation on coding and start my path towards learning
            about AI. Eventually,
            I’d like to have a hand in the AI involved with autonomous vehicles.<br /><br />
