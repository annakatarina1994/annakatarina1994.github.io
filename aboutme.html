    <h1 class="aboutMeTitle">About Me</h1>
    <p class="aboutMeStatement">Throughout my life, I’ve found myself taking an interest in a vast array of subjects.
      I’ve always been a fan of discovering new things, whether it’s a new trail to hike on, a new medium to create with
      or a new language to learn. I’m an artist, avid learner, gearhead and developer all snugly wrapped into
      one.<br><br>
      At times, I struggled with this. I didn’t have the benefit of knowing where my place was in this world early on.
      It felt like the world had too much to offer and I didn’t have enough time to try it all. I’m at a point in my
      life now, however, where I feel like I’ve finally found a place for myself and it’s in the software development
      world. <br><br>
      My interest lies primarily in creating applications and websites with exemplary user interfaces, drawing a lot of
      my design choices from my background in behavioral psychology to the many years I’ve spent painting in my free
      time.
